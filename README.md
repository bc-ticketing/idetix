4. Create a new local branch beginning with the issue number (e.g., `4-feature`).
5. Commit to this branch mentioning the issue number in the commit message (e.g. `add functionality xyz (#4)`
6. Finish your implementation on the branch
7. Pull and merge the latest changes from `origin/master` into your local branch
8. Verify that your changes still work as expected
9. Merge your branch into `master` and push the changes
10. Close the issue and move it to the _Done_ column of the _Ticketing dApp_ project
## Generate ABIs

```bash
truffle compile
```

This generates the ABIs in a new folder `idetix/abi` in the root directory. Use these files to interact with the smart contracts from your web app.

## Deploy contracts on the test network

Make sure Ganache is running on port `7545` or change the port in `truffle-config.js`.

```bash
truffle migrate --reset
```

## Test

Install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the tests:

```bash
tuffle test
```
